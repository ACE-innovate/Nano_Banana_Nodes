use GenAI SDK NOT generativeai

Python (current): google-genai → official SDK. 
PyPI

The older libs are now legacy/deprecated:

Python google-generativeai → legacy, migrate to google-genai. 
PyPI

Google renamed/merged to a unified “Google GenAI SDK” with Gemini 2.0; docs and quickstarts now point to genai
